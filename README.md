# How to Install and Configure Postfix and Dovecot on Debian 12 (Local Mail Server)
VM Configuration:

â€¢ Name: mail-server

â€¢ OS:  Debian 12

â€¢ CPU: 2 Cores

â€¢ RAM: 6GB

â€¢ Disk: 32GB

â€¢ Network: Bridge mode

â€¢ Domain: firma.ua

## Terminology Explained

- **Postfix**: A Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) responsible for sending and receiving emails.
- **Dovecot**: An IMAP/POP3 server used for receiving and storing emails securely.
- **Mailbox**: Storage location for emails; we use Maildir format (each email is a separate file).
- **Local Mail**: All emails are stored and accessed inside the server, without external internet relay.

---

## Step 1: Install Postfix

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postfix -y
```

- During installation, select "Internet Site."
- Set the system mail name (your local domain, e.g., `firma.ua`).

Reconfigure Postfix if needed:

```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix
```

- **Home Mailbox**:
```bash
sudo postconf -e 'home_mailbox= mail/'
```

- **Virtual Alias Map**:
```bash
sudo postconf -e 'virtual_alias_maps= hash:/etc/postfix/virtual'
sudo nano /etc/postfix/virtual
```
this file our data storage for users(e.g., ` mail`user1@firma.ua`     `username`user1`)

```
sudo postmap /etc/postfix/virtual
```

Restart Postfix:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart postfix
sudo systemctl status postfix
```

Check open ports:

```bash
netstat -tlpn
```

You should see port `25` (SMTP) open.

### Verify Postfix Installation

```bash
postconf mail_version
```

- Displays Postfix version if installed correctly.

---

## Step 2: Create Local Email Users

```bash
sudo adduser user1
sudo adduser user2
```

Each user will have their mailbox under `/home/username/mail/`.

---

## Step 3: Install Dovecot

```bash
sudo apt install dovecot-imapd dovecot-core dovecot-pop3d -y
```

### Verify Dovecot Installation

```bash
dovecot --version
```

### Check if Dovecot is running

```bash
sudo systemctl status dovecot
```

---

## Step 4: Basic Setup for Dovecot

for a full working Postfix+Dovecot integration, especially when SMTP Authentication is needed, we must also configure:

Edit mailbox settings:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf
```

Find and set:

In most modern Dovecot setups, Maildir default location is ~/Maildir (with capital M) ```mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir```.
BUT â€” in my Postfix setup I clearly defined this line:

 So, Dovecot must match where Postfix delivers emails. Therefore, the correct setting for me is:
 
```bash
mail_location = maildir:~/mail
```
Otherwise Dovecot would look in wrong directory and not find my mails!


```bash
sudo nano /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf
```

Find and set: 
```  listen= *,:```âž” Makes Dovecot listen on all network interfaces (important for IMAP and SMTP authentication).

```bash
sudo nano -l /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-auth.conf
```

Find and set:  
```  disable_plaintex_auth=no ```     ```auth_mechanisms=plain login```

âž” Allows Dovecot to accept plaintext login when STARTTLS is not configured (local testing).

```bash
sudo nano -l /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-master.conf
```

Find and set:

```bash
unix_listner /var/spool/postfix/auth {
  mode= 0666
  user=postfix
  group=postfix
}
```
âž” So that Postfix can authenticate SMTP users via Dovecot.

Restart Dovecot:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart dovecot
sudo systemctl status dovecot
```
If you want to see open ports:

```netstat -tlpn``` 

If you want to check if firewall (ufw) is running: ```sudo ufw status``
If ufw is not installed, install it: ```sudo apt install ufw```
sudo ufw enable ```sudo ufw enable```
Open required ports: 
```
sudo ufw allow 25/tcp
sudo ufw allow 110/tcp
sudo ufw allow 143/tcp

```


ðŸ”¥ Ports You Need to Open (Postfix + Dovecot + Thunderbird):
|Port | Protocol | Service | Description | Use|
|:-----|:--------|:-----|:--------|:-----|
|25 | TCP | SMTP (Postfix) | Sending emails between servers and from client (Thunderbird) if you configure SMTP | Required |
|110 | TCP | POP3 (Dovecot) | Receiving emails by downloading to client (Thunderbird POP3 account) | Optional if using POP3 |
|143 | TCP | IMAP (Dovecot) | Receiving emails (Thunderbird IMAP account, emails stay on server) | Recommended instead of POP3 |
|587 | TCP | SMTP (Submission) (Postfix) | Sending email securely from client to server (better than port 25) | Highly Recommended |
|993 | TCP | IMAPS (Dovecot) | Secure IMAP (IMAP over SSL/TLS) | Optional if you use SSL/TLS |
|995 | TCP | POP3S (Dovecot) | Secure POP3 (POP3 over SSL/TLS) | Optional if you use SSL/TLS |

âœ… Minimum for you (local testing without SSL):

Port 25 â†’ for SMTP sending

Port 110 â†’ for POP3 receiving (if you use POP3)

Port 143 â†’ for IMAP receiving (if you use IMAP)

(Thunderbird will need either 110 or 143 depending on your choice.)

---
âœ… So in my case, everything must be aligned:

Postfix writes mails to ~/mail/

Dovecot reads mails from ~/mail/

Dovecot allows authentication

Dovecot listens on all interfaces

Postfix can authenticate clients (Thunderbird) over port 25.

## Step 5: Configure Mail Domain (Local Domain)

Ensure `/etc/hosts` contains:

```bash
127.0.0.1   localhost firma.ua
```

Replace `firma.ua` with your server hostname if needed.

---

## Step 6: Setup Email Client (Thunderbird)

Thunderbird must be opened from a graphical environment. in my Ubuntu install and run thunderbird.

```sudo apt install thunderbird``` and run ```thunderbird &``` or ```thunderbird -P```

**Settings for Thunderbird email client:**

1. Open Thunderbird > Add New Account.
2. Enter Name, Email (e.g., user1@example.local), and Password(e.g.,user123).
3. Click "Manual Config."
4. Fill in the settings as shown above.
5. Click "Done." (and Advansed config)

 **Manual config:**
 
Setting | Incoming (POP3) | Outgoing (SMTP)
|:-----|:--------|:-----|
Server hostname | your server IP or hostname (in my case 192.168.10.107) | 192.168.10.107
Port | 110 (POP3 or IMAP) | 25 (SMTP )
SSL | None (without SSL) | None (without SSL)
Authentication | Normal password | Normal password

 ![ing](https://github.com/Sonakhach/mail_box/blob/main/Screenshot%20from%202025-04-28%2016-56-10.png)

```ip a``` give  your WM ip, than is your server ip (e. g., 192.168.10.107)

Thunderbird will try to connect to your server.

If everything is set up correctly (Postfix and Dovecot are working properly), you will be able to receive and send emails.

---
ðŸŒŸ Special Note
Since you are not using SSL yet, this means you need to make sure that the ports are open in your firewall (110, 25) and that your server's Postfix/Dovecot configs are working without TLS.

When I want all users' emails to be stored in the same local folder, I need to make a small change.

How to enable Maildir in Thunderbird
Open Thunderbird.

From the top menu, go to:
Edit â†’ Preferences (or Settings in different versions).

Open the General section.

At the end, you will find the Config Editor... button, click it.

Search for the following key (type it in search).
```mail.store.default_store_contractid```   You need to change the value like this:   ```@mozilla.org/msgstore/maildirstore;1```  and make restar thunderbird

Emails received during the new profile will now be closed in separate files.

# Conclusion

- Postfix handles outgoing and local delivery of emails.
- Dovecot manages client access to mailboxes.
- Using Maildir format ensures better mail storage (one file per email).
- Fully local setup means emails never leave your server.
-

You now have a working local email server for testing and internal communication with Thunderbird!
